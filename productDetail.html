                <h4>Brain to conquer negative thoughts. Here’s how:</h4>
                All humans have a tendency to be a bit more like Eeyore than Tigger, to ruminate more on bad experiences
                than positive ones. It’s an evolutionary adaptation — over-learning from the dangerous
                or hurtful situations we encounter through life (bullying, trauma, betrayal) helps us avoid them in
                the future and react quickly in a crisis. But that means you have to work a little harder to train
                your

                Don’t try to stop negative thoughts. Telling yourself “I have to stop thinking about this,”
                only makes you think about it more. Instead, own your worries. When you are in a negative cycle,
                acknowledge it. “I’m worrying about money.” “I’m obsessing about problems at work.”
                Treat yourself like a friend. When you are feeling negative about yourself, ask yourself what advice
                would you give a friend who was down on herself. Now try to apply that advice to you.
                Challenge your negative thoughts. Socratic questioning is the process of challenging and changing
                irrational thoughts. Studies show that this method can reduce depression symptoms. The goal is to
                get you from a negative mindset (“I’m a failure.”) to a more positive one (“I’ve had a lot of
                success in my career. This is just one setback that doesn’t reflect on me. I can learn from it and
                be better.”) Here are some examples of questions you can ask yourself to challenge negative
                thinking.
                First, write down your negative thought, such as “I’m having problems at work and am questioning my
                abilities.”

                <h4>Controlled Breathing</h4>
                Science is just beginning to provide evidence that the benefits of this ancient practice are real.
                Studies have found, for example, that breathing practices can help reduce symptoms associated with
                anxiety, insomnia, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and attention deficit disorder. For
                centuries yogis have used breath control, or pranayama, to promote concentration and improve vitality.
                Buddha advocated breath-meditation as a way to reach enlightenment.

                Try it.
                <h4>Rewrite Your Story</h4>
                Writing about oneself and personal experiences — and then rewriting your story — can lead to behavioral
                changes and improve happiness. (We already know that expressive writing can improve mood disorders and
                help reduce symptoms among cancer patients, among other health benefits.)

                Some research suggests that writing in a personal journal for 15 minutes a day can lead to a boost in
                overall happiness and well-being, in part because it allows us to express our emotions, be mindful of
                our circumstances and resolve inner conflicts. Or you can take the next step and focus on one particular
                challenge you face, and write and rewrite that story.

                We all have a personal narrative that shapes our view of the world and ourselves. But sometimes our
                inner voice doesn’t get it right. By writing and then editing our own stories, we can change our
                perceptions of ourselves and identify obstacles that stand in the way of our personal well-being. The
                process is similar to Socratic questioning (referenced above). Here’s a writing exercise:
                <blockquote>
                    Write a brief story about your struggle. I’m having money problems. I am having a hard time making
                    friends in a new city. I’m never going to find love. I’m fighting with my spouse. Now write a new
                    story from the viewpoint of a neutral observer, or with the kind of encouragement
                    you’d give a friend.
                </blockquote>

                Money is a challenge but you can take steps to get yourself into financial shape.
                Everyone struggles in their first year in a new city. Give it some time. Join some groups.
                Don’t focus on finding love. Focus on meeting new people and having fun. The rest will follow.
                Couples argue. Here’s what your situation looks like to a neutral observer.
                Numerous studies show that writing and rewriting your story can move you out of your negative mindset
                and into a more positive view of life. “The idea here is getting people to come to terms with who they
                are, where they want to go,” said James Pennebaker, a psychology professor at the University of Texas
                who has pioneered much of the research on expressive writing. “I think of expressive writing as a life
                course correction.”</p>
